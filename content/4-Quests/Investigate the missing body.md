[[Father Zantus]] approached the party with concerns about the fate of [[Noalia]]'s soul.  He feels that she was badly treated by the people of [[Sandpoint]] and this is what drove her to extreme actions.  He is concerned that she is suffering undue torment in the afterlife and wishes to see this is not the case.

He has agreed with [[Aldrani]] that they will perform a ritual to allow the father to speak with Noalia's sprit to ensure this is not the case.  In order to do this they need a physical link to the soul of the deceased and, lacking any other option, the father opted to exhume Noalia's interred body.

Upon digging down to the casket and opening the lid the father found that the body was not there!  The ground then collapsed, revealing that the casket had been tunnelled into from below!  It was at this point that the good father retreated and decided to enlist the aid of local adventurers of modest renown.

They were out of town, so he turned to his next best option and hit our party up in the Dragon's Punchbowl with the offer of a free lunch, which frankly was more than was necessary.  A pint of warm ale and a stale sandwich would probably have sufficed.

[[Poll]] believes we are dealing with Goblins.  Zantus believes it is more likely Ghouls.

In addition to a chest of supplies distributed between the party members Zantus also promised payment of 75 gp per person (so excluding Larry, Kurogane and Dia) plus any healing required upon the party's return.
