Noalia is a foundling who was taken in by [[Edizikin Tobin]].  Tobin treated her badly, turning her into a kind of lucky charm for the town resulting in near constant harassment by the populace.

In an attempt to be free of this cult like behaviour Noalia set a fire in the cathedral which burnt most of the structure down, killing Tobin.  She later made a pact with a group of people with the aim of destroying [[Sandpoint]] and was killed in the attempt.  They were buried in the cemetery in Sandpoint.
