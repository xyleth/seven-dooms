# What happened

After finalising character creation and some light shopping play started in the Dragon's Punchbowl.  The party was approached by [[Father Zantus]] with the offer of lunch and a job, so naturally we agreed to meet him for lunch at the Cathedral.

Before attending our dinner date Amber led the party to a local bakery and purchased a tray of confections to take as an guest gift.  The majority of these ended up inside [[Poll]], somehow.  One wonders where she finds the room.  Gnomes.

After loading up on sugar the party went to the cathederal where they recieved the [[Investigate the missing body]] quest from Father Zantus.  See that entry for the details.

The session concluded there.
