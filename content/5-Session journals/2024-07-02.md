# Session Overview

We pick up where we left off in a room full of dead goblin-ghouls.  Poll, riding high from their success in calling the nature of the foe, raises the topic of healing via explosion once again.  This time, possibly due to loss of blood and other bodily fluids, the party agrees.  At the last minute she changes her mind and resorts to regular first aid, working around the party starting with Kimiko and making an excellent job of it.  Next an equally job on Capella.

While this is going on Capella and Elara attempt to identify a wand found on the lead goblin.  Attempt being the key word, after twenty minutes of peering, poking and, in Capella's case, sniffing and a clandestine lick they are none the wiser as to its function.  Poll then attempts to identify the wand while Larry explodes next to her, which does amazingly heal her.  Or at least cauterise her wounds, which has the same net effect.  While she pulls out a wrench to work on Larry, Kimiko takes a look at the wand and works out that it is a Wand of Fear.

This whole process took 40 minutes during which nothing else tried to eat or kill us, which we consider a win.

Capella decides to go poke a hole.  After a short way the tunnel opens out into a stone floored room.  The room has 7 pointed starts carved into the east and west walls and rubble in other corners.  The rubble has clearly landed on some goblins as a bounty of goblin limbs are to be found emerging from the rubble.  The stars look a bit like this:

Capella identifies it as a Sidheron, the symbol of ancient Thassalon and therefore bad juju.  Capella susses out that the rockfall is due to a trap that the goblins triggered, saving us from being squished.  Clearing some of the rubble Capella manages to open the door.  The rooms are lit by what appear to be magical torches that cast light but no heat.

This is an area full of small, closet sized, rooms.  In one there is an old map of pre-Earthfall Sandpoint and envrons.  It is labelled in Thassolonian which Elara happens to speak:
- Sandpoint is labelled as 'HF Compound'
- A statue of Karzug is labelled in the area now occupied by Thistletop
- There is a large circular area labelled 'the Pit' with a report saying 'Captured spies whisper of a sizable Shalast cohort stationed here, led by someone named Liralarueâ€”must secure authorization from Mistress for a raid.'

Capella stashes the map in amongst his gear.  Larry opens a door to, surprise, another store room.  This place sucks.  In the store room is a keyring with an Iron key and some kind of novelty key.  There is also a old and fragile scroll which contains notes from someone called Jasper with notes on how to pass **the three steps**, this is a part of the building that can be coded to set a trap off if not passed properly.  Jasper is apparently a bit of a dick as there are notes on a few unfortunate subordinates to whom he is giving incorrect instructions to teach them a lesson.  Elara takes the scroll, Poll takes the keys.

Larry finally opens a door with something other than dusty old books behind it.  Instead it has a odd cow like creature within it and, in keeping with tradition and our luck, does not want to sit down for tea and biscuits.  A fight ensues.

It is some kind of divine warden.  Poll deduces that when 'killed' it will explode with divine fury, damaging and possibly cursing any near it.  Eventually it is killed, and it does indeed explode hurting Capella and Kurogane and cursing them both.

This is where we leave it for the evening.
