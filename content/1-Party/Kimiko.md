Kimiko is a Frost wind [Kitsune](https://2e.aonprd.com/Ancestries.aspx?ID=38) [Summoner](https://2e.aonprd.com/Classes.aspx?ID=18).  He hails originally from [Minkai](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Minkai) where he was born to a family of Kitsune in a town with a established openly Kitsune population.  As a consequence he is most comfortable, and most often found, in his Fox form as opposed to human.

As a teen Kimiko ventured into a sacred cave near his home town where he encountered a crack in the fabric of reality leading to the elemental plane of metal.  Here he made contact with the elemental sprit [[Kurogane]] who was seeking a way to manifest on the material plane.  The two reached an agreement and thus began Kimiko's career as a summoner.

For as yet undescribed reasons Kimiko had to leave his home and ventured to [Alkenstar](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Alkenstar) where he became embroiled in the never ending wars in the [Mana wastes](https://pathfinderwiki.com/wiki/Mana_Wastes).  It was during this service that he lost his right leg below the knee which was replaced with a clockwork prosthesis.

After this event Kimiko vowed never to allow his fate to be dictated by another again and quit his commission to take up the adventuring life.  It is this life that has lead him to Sandpoint and the company he currently keeps.
